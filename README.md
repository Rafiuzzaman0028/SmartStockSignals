ðŸ“ˆ SmartStockSignals
A machine learning-driven trading strategy that predicts stock market signals using technical indicators like SMA, RSI, MACD, and more. The project includes real-time data fetching from Yahoo Finance (yfinance), signal generation, feature scaling, and backtesting against a buy-and-hold benchmark.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Fetches historical stock data using yfinance

âœ… Computes technical indicators: SMA, RSI, MACD

âœ… Builds predictive signals using machine learning (placeholder for model)

âœ… Scales features using StandardScaler

âœ… Backtests strategy returns vs buy-and-hold

âœ… Visualizes cumulative returns over time

ðŸ§  Technical Indicators Used
SMA (Simple Moving Averages): 10-day, 50-day

RSI (Relative Strength Index)

MACD and MACD Signal Line

Return: Daily log returns

Future_Close: Next day's closing price (for supervised ML training)

ðŸ“Š Model & Signal Logic
This version uses a placeholder logic for signals (e.g., SMA crossover or ML-based classification). You can train a model like:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

LSTM (for sequential modeling)
